User Experience Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my UX Portfolio! In here you will find examples of my past work. 

The Fitness Chick 

  Done for graduate class UX Design II. 
  
  The Fitness Chick is an example of an ecommerce website. The clickable prototype can be found here: https://xd.adobe.com/view/727d467c-9d4b-45a8-485a-bad9542119ef-044c/?fullscreen 
  
  
Dunkin' 

  Done for graduate class UX Design I. 
  
  This project is to show how an already great website could be made better. For this assignment I took 3 different areas of the Dunkin website and made improvements. Please check out the report for the before/after.
